## Overview

This application helps you merge multiple channels of multispectral images into a single RGB image. It's particularly useful when you have separate images for different spectral bands (like red, green, or blue channels) and want to combine them into a single color image.

**Notes**

- The original project and images remain unchanged
- Make sure all channel images have the same dimensions
- The app will skip groups where any required channel is missing

## Features

- **Channel Order Control**: Define the order of channels in the output RGB image
- **Annotation Preservation**: All labels and annotations are preserved in the merged image
- **Project Structure**: Maintains the original dataset hierarchy
- **Project Synchronization**: Automatically synchronizes with existing projects based on source project name

## How to Use

### Step 1: Launch the App

1. Open the app from the Supervisely ecosystem / Context menu of project / Context menu of dataset
2. Configure the channel order in the modal window

### Step 2: Configure Channel Order

In the modal window, you need to specify the order of channels in YAML format:
```yaml
R: _0  # Red channel (replace _0 with your red channel suffix)
G: _1  # Green channel (replace _1 with your green channel suffix)
B: _2  # Blue channel (replace _2 with your blue channel suffix)
```

Replace the suffixes (_0, _1, _2) with the actual suffixes used in your image filenames.

### Step 3: Run the App

1. Click "Run" to start the merging process
2. Monitor the progress in the logs
3. Wait for the process to complete
4. New project will appear on workspace tasks page

### Step 4: Access Results

- A new project will be created with the prefix "Merged multispectral" followed by the source project name
- The new project maintains the same structure as the source project
- Each merged image will be saved as a PNG file
- All annotations are preserved and attached to the merged images

## Project Synchronization

The application features project synchronization based on the source project name:

- When you run the app, it searches for existing projects with the name pattern "Merged multispectral {original_project_name}"
- If a matching project exists, the app will:
  - Use the existing project structure
  - Identify datasets with new images to process
  - Only process new images that don't already exist in the destination project
  - Skip images that have already been processed
- If no matching project exists, a new project will be created with the proper name and structure

## Examples

### Input Images

Your source images might look like this:
- `image_0.png` (Red channel)
- `image_1.png` (Green channel)
- `image_2.png` (Blue channel)

### Output
The app will create a single RGB image combining all channels:
- `image.png` (Combined RGB image)

### Channel Order Example

If your images are named like this:

```text
image_red.png
image_green.png
image_blue.png
```

Your YAML configuration should be:

```yaml
R: _red
G: _green
B: _blue
```
